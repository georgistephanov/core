/**
 * I started this project simply so that I can learn the Java syntax.
 * This project has been the transition from C++ to Java for me, as
 * we are going to learn it during the first year at university.
 * Initially I planned to make this project similar to the CORE Cashless
 * System and then make an Android app out of it just for fun. However,
 * gradually I changed the path, as this particular android app is
 * going to be practically useless and pointless to make. I came up with
 * an idea for android app better by a mile, so I just continued working
 * on this project as a Console simulation of a semi-functioning online
 * store. I almost quit after some time, as again this too is a virtually
 * pointless app, but decided to keep on going just so that I could gain
 * some confidence in Java and make the transition from C++ faster.
